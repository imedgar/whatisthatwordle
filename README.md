## What is that wordle?

The idea came to me (as a non native english speaker, very often) playing wordle with my GF, once you have or have not solved the word, you don't have any clue what that word means. 
Honestly I was pretty surprised this is still not a feature of the game itself. 

So , this simple chrome extension will look up for the WORDLE of the day once the game is finished (won't matter if it's a win or lose)
Works only for [NYTimes Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

### Features

* Looks up for the word of the day once the game is finished.
* Will open a new tab with the word meaning e.g: [Wedge](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/wedge)
