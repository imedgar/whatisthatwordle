## What Does That Wordle Mean?

As a non-native English speaker, I often found myself playing Wordle with my girlfriend and wondering: *What does this word actually mean?* Once you've finished the game—whether you won or lost—there’s no built-in way to see the definition of the Wordle word of the day.

Honestly, I was surprised this isn’t already a feature in the game itself!

This simple Chrome extension solves that problem by automatically looking up the Wordle word of the day as soon as the game is finished.

> **Note:** This extension works only for [NYTimes Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

### Features

- Automatically looks up the Wordle word of the day after the game ends.
- Opens a new tab with the word’s definition, for example: [Wedge](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/wedge).
